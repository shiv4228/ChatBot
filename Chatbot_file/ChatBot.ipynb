      "page_content='Data Storytelling & Methodology Document  \\n– AirBnb, New York Analysis using Python  \\nBy – Shivansh singh, Aparna Sahu, Manish Matsaniya  \\nA. Methodology Approach  \\n1. Research Problem  \\n\\uf0b7 For the past few months, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue due to the lockdown imposed \\nduring the pandemic.  \\n\\uf0b7 Now after 2 years of devastating Covid pandemic, the restrictions knot have started losing, and people \\nhave started to travel more. Hence, Airbnb wants to make sure to be fully prepared for this change.  \\n \\n2. Business Under standing  \\n \\n- Airbnb id an American company based in San Francisco, California. It operates an online market places \\nfor lodging, primarily home stays for vacation rental, and tourism activities. The platform can be \\nreachable via its web sites and mobile applic ation.  \\n- Being as online market place for hosting personal home stays and private apartments in the majority, and \\nsue to this, company have basically two types of customers. One who host their place and the another who \\nbook the place for a particular time is  the end consumer utilizing  the hosted place.  \\n- Airbnb earn commission from both ends and hence Airbnb wants to sure  about both the customers that \\nare able to generate values from their business.  \\n- It also offered hosted place on the platform to provide the best services at reasonable prices and lookout \\nfor the best technology to ease out the booking process for the end consumer without hassle.  \\n \\n3. Type of Data required to Analyze  \\n \\n- The decline in the revenue of the company could have many reasons, either platform service is not so \\ngood or home /apartment service and reviews are not so impressive. It could also happen that, Airbnb \\nhome locations are not on the right place, might be to o far away from the Airports or any private travel \\nagency. It could also happens that prices are too high to afford and too low to attract or impress customers \\ndue to the negative mindset of   having bad services with cheap homes/apartments.  \\n \\n4. How Data has a cquired ? (Assumption)  \\n \\n- The Provided data is captured from the CRM tool used by Airbnb to  manage their customers  that are \\nhosting sites on their platform.  \\n- The reviews provided in the data frame are assumed to be positive as it is not mentioned whether the y are \\nin negative or positive reviews.  \\n \\n5. Whom we are presenting ?  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Data Analysis Managers :  These people manages the data directly for the processes and their technical \\nexpertise.  \\n\\uf0b7 Lead Data Analyst :  It looks after the entire team of the data and business analyst and it should have \\nsome technical taste.  \\n\\uf0b7 Head of Acquis itions and Operations, NYC:   It looks after the property and hosts acquisition and \\noperations.  Acquisition of the best properties, pric e negotiating and service negotiating for properties \\noffers, all these work fall under this head role.  \\n\\uf0b7 Head of User Experience, NYC :  It looks after the customer preference and handles the properties listed \\non the website and the Airbnb app. Basically, it tries to optimize the order of property listing in certain \\nneighborhoods and cities in order to get property the optimal amount of traction.  \\n \\n6.
